Exciting Opportunity: Seeking Collaborators for Freelancing

I am actively involved in software development and am currently seeking trustworthy collaborators to support me. I am confident that you could significantly contribute to our initiatives.

Before delving further, I'd like to inquire if you are familiar with platforms such as Freelancer.com and Upwork.com. If these are new to you, I invite you to visit the following URLs for more information:
Freelancer.com: https://www.freelancer.com/
Upwork.com: https://www.upwork.com/

Now, let me outline what I am looking for and how you can be a part of this opportunity:

Upwork
Upwork | The Worldâ€™s Work Marketplace
Upwork connects businesses with independent professionals and agencies around the globe. Where companies and freelancers work together in new ways that unlock their potential.
Freelancer.com and Upwork.com Accounts:
I am in need of Freelancer.com and Upwork.com accounts. If you are able to provide both, that would be fantastic. However, if you can offer just one, that is equally appreciated.

Account Creation Assistance:
If you haven't created accounts on these platforms yet, there's no need to worry. I can guide you through the process, making it a seamless experience.

Compensation:
In return for your collaboration, I am offering to share 10 percent of the monthly earnings generated through freelancing. As an experienced software engineer, I typically earn over US$ 2,000 per month on one platform. This means you could potentially earn over US$ 200 or US$ 400 (if you can provide both Freelancer.com and Upwork.com accounts) per month by renting out your account.

Technical Requirements:
I would require access to a computer with your accounts, which should remain turned on 24/7. We can use remote tools like Anydesk for ease of access. In occasional instances, your presence may be needed for a video call.

Ensuring Trust:
I understand concerns about potential scams. Rest assured, there is no benefit for me in engaging in any fraudulent activity. Any funds earned using your Freelancer or Upwork account can only be withdrawn to your payment account, ensuring that you have complete control over the funds.

If you are interested in exploring this opportunity further, I would be delighted to schedule a brief call or meeting to discuss details and address any questions you may have. Please let me know a time that suits you, or share any specific information you'd like me to provide in advance.

Thank you for considering this collaboration, and I look forward to the possibility of working together to achieve outstanding results.
